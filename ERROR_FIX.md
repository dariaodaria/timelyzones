# ðŸš¨ Quick Fix for Internal Server Error

## Most likely causes:
1. TypeScript compilation error
2. Missing import
3. Invalid Tailwind classes
4. Build cache issue

## Quick fixes to try:

### 1. Restart the dev server:
```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

### 2. Clear Next.js cache:
```bash
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

### 3. Check for TypeScript errors:
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### 4. Check specific error in terminal:
Look for the exact error message in your terminal where you ran `npm run dev`

## If the error persists:

The issue is likely in the responsive classes I added. Let me know the exact error message from your terminal and I can fix it immediately.

Common issues might be:
- Invalid Tailwind class names
- Missing React import
- TypeScript type errors
- Build configuration issues

## Emergency rollback:
If needed, I can revert the mobile optimizations to get the app working again, then apply them gradually.
